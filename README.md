# Daily Weather Data Analysis

This is a simple data analysis project that reads daily weather data from a CSV file and visualizes the temperature trends over time using Python and matplotlib.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset should be a CSV file named `weather.csv` and must include at least the following columns:

| Date       | MaxTemp |
|------------|---------|
| 2024-01-01 | 29.5    |
| 2024-01-02 | 30.0    |

> You can use real weather data from sources like Kaggle, NOAA, or other weather APIs.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
